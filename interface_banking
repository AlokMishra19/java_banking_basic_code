Assume that a bank maintains two types of account for its customers, one called a savings account and other called a current account. The savings account provides compound interest and withdrawal facilities but no cheque book facility. The current account provides a check book facility but no interest. Current account holders should also maintain a minimum balance (say Rs. 1000) and if the balance falls below this level a service charge is imposed (say Rs. 100).
Create a class Account that stores customer name, account number and type of account. From this class derive two classes Curr_Acct and Savn_Acct respectively to make them more specific to their requirements. Include the necessary methods to achieve the following tasks:
a.	Accept deposits from a customer and update the balance.
b.	Display the balance.
c.	Compute and deposit interest.
d.	Permit withdrawal and update the balance.
e.	Check for minimum balance, impose penalty, if necessary, and update the balance. Use constructors to initialize the class members.
